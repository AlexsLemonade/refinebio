Without limiting any other applicable obligations or restrictions, you will keep strictly confidential (using at least reasonable care), and not disclose or make available to any third party, any information you obtain or access via, regarding or in connection with the CCDL that is marked as confidential or should reasonably be treated as confidential (excluding information specifically identified by us or the source as non-confidential).

Modifications to the CCDL

We reserve the right to modify, discontinue and restrict, temporarily or permanently, all or part of the CCDL (including any Content) without notice in our sole discretion.

Upon any suspension or termination of your access, you must immediately cease using the CCDL.

Feedback

Any comments, suggestions, ideas or other information, related to the CCDL, submitted by you to us or the CCDL (collectively, "Feedback") are non-confidential (notwithstanding any notice to the contrary you may include in any accompanying communication), and you hereby grant to us and our affiliates a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable and fully sublicensable right to use your Feedback for any purpose and in any manner without compensation or attribution to you. Where required by applicable law or regulation, we will respect any privacy restrictions applicable to Feedback you communicate to us.

Copyright Infringement

We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask you to do the same. It is our policy to terminate the access privileges of those who infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your work has been posted on the CCDL in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please contact us at the address below and provide the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (b) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, and identification of the time(s) and date(s) the material that you claim is infringing was displayed on the CCDL; (c) your address, telephone number, and email address; (d) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (e) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.

If you believe that your User Content which has been removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to applicable law, to post and use such User Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the copyright agent: (a) your physical or electronic signature; (b) identification of the User Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the materials appeared before it was removed or disabled; (c) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the User Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the User Content; and (d) your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, you consent to the jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the district or state in which you are located (or, if you are located outside of the US, any federal or state court in which we may be found), and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. If a counter-notice is received by the copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party.

Our designated agent for notice of copyright infringement can be reached at:

Reference to any products, services, processes or other information, by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation thereof by us, or vice versa.

Ownership

We, our affiliates and our licensors collectively own all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the CCDL. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms.

Third-Party Content

The CCDL may contain links or otherwise provide access to Web pages, services, data or other content of third parties (collectively, "Third-Party Content"). Your access to or use of any Third-Party Content is at your sole risk. We do not monitor, endorse, or adopt, or have any control over, any Third-Party Content. Under no circumstances will we be responsible or liable in any way for or in connection with any Third-Party Content. Third-Party Content may be subject to separate terms and conditions. You should review, and you are solely responsible for complying with, any such third-party terms. You acknowledge and agree that we may use third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology used to operate the CCDL.

Indemnification

You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, agents, employees, licensors, and suppliers from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising out of or related to your User Content, your use of the CCDL (or any activity under your account or credentials), your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of a third party, except to the extent arising from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Warranty Disclaimers

except as expressly set forth in these terms, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, (a) we hereby disclaim all warranties related to the ccdl, or any services, data or other content available thereon or associated therewith, including without limitation the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement and fitness for a particular purpose; and (b) the ccdl is provided "as is" and without any warranty related to accuracy, completeness, quality or that the ccdl will be uninterrupted or error free.

we make no representations or warranties regarding, and explicitly disclaim the appropriateness or applicability of any content to, any specific patient’s care or treatment. nor do we make any representations or warranties regarding the use, or the results of the use, of any content in treatment. all content accessible in connection with the ccdl is for informational purposes only. data and other content are not a substitute for professional advice on any matter, medical or otherwise. always seek the advice of a qualified health professional. any clinician is expected to use independent medical judgment in the context of individual clinical circumstances of a specific patient’s care or treatment. we do not recommend or endorse any treatment, institution, professional, physician, product, procedure, or other information that may be mentioned in connection with the ccdl.

to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, neither us nor our officers, directors, licensors, or suppliers will be liable to any party under these terms or otherwise for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with the use or access of or inability to use or access the ccdl or any services or content made available through the ccdl, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (regardless of the basis of the claim and even if advised of the possibility of these damages).

to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, our and our suppliers’ and licensors’ maximum total liability to you for all claims under these terms or otherwise in connection with the ccdl is $50, regardless of the basis of the claim.

applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of certain warranties or liabilities, so the above limitations or exclusions may not fully apply to you. in such cases, you agree that because such warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and us (and are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between you and us), our and our licensors’ and suppliers’ liability will be limited to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law. the limitations in this section will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law.

You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.

    Jurisdiction. Unless otherwise agreed in writing between you and us, any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the CCDL or these Terms must be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts within the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (except that a party may seek preliminary equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in relation to intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations).

General

Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances. We will not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay to perform any of our obligations under these Terms resulting from any event or circumstance beyond our reasonable control. Any provision of these Terms that is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable will be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law and in all other jurisdictions and circumstances (and otherwise will be severed from these Terms), and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue to be in full force and effect. The section headings and titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. You may not assign or delegate any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent, and any purported assignment in contravention of the foregoing will be null and void. These Terms will be binding upon and enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the CCDL or these Terms must be commenced within one year after the claim arose.

These Terms, including all Policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the CCDL. These Terms supersede all prior agreements or communications between you and us regarding the subject matter of these Terms.
