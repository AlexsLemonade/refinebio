"""This processor is currently out of date. It is designed to process
multiple CEL files at a time, but that is not how we are going to
process Array Express files. I have rewritten the Array Express
surveyor/downloader to support this, but we don't have the new
processor yet. This will run, which is good enough for testing
the system, however since it will change so much the processor
itself is not yet tested.
