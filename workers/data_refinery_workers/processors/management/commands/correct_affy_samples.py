"""Tries to find and correct mislabelled Affymetrix samples.

See https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/refinebio/issues/968 for more
context, but essentially we had a bug in the surveyor where if a GEO
superseries had an RNA-Seq sample in it, then all the samples would be
labelled as RNA-SEQ, including samples that were actually
Microarray. This command will correct any such Affymetrix samples by
checking their filenames to see if they are .CEL files. If they are
the file is downloaded and we use affy.io to read the header and
determine the platform accesion code and name.
