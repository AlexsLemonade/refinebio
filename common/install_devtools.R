# This script installs version 1.13.6 of the R package devtools.

# Because devtools is the tool which will install specific versions of
# other R packages, it cannot be used it to install itself. However in
# order to ensure there are no dependency conflicts, it also needs to
# pin each version of its dependencies.

# This script uses install.packages to install all of the dependencies
# for devtools, however install.packages unfortunately does not
# recursively install dependencies for the packages it
# installs. Therefore this script installs every dependency up the
# chain to devtools. It's not ideal, but it guarantees a stable
# install of devtools that won't break when a new version of devtools
# is released.
