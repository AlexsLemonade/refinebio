#!/bin/bash -e

# This script can be used as the instance-user-data.sh script for AWS
# instances to configure a new instance to be used as a deploy box.


# To create a new deploy box (there only ever needs to be one at a
# time.), there are few steps to follow using the AWS console:
#  - Make sure there is a deploy VPC. If there isn't create one so the deploy box is isolated.
#    See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/gsg_create_vpc.html for detailed instructions.

#  - Make sure the deploy VPC has a security group. If it doesn't create one and allow ingress
#    TCP connections on port 22 from 0.0.0.0/0
#    See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html for detailed instructions.

#  - Make an AWS Key Pair named `data-refinery-deployer` by importing the data-refinery-key.pem
#    key (which is in the same directory as this script)into AWS if it does not already exist:
#    See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws
#    for detailed instructions.

#  - Create a new EC2 instance with the following settings:
#    - Select an Ubuntu 18.04 HVM SSD AMI for the region. If you are using us-east-1 then
#      ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-20180912 (ami-0ac019f4fcb7cb7e6)
#      should be correct.
#    - A t3.medium instance should be sufficient.
#    - Set the EBS volume to have at least 100 GB.
#    - Use the deploy VPC and security group referenced in earlier steps.
#    - It needs to have a public IP address (so set 'Auto-assign Public IP' to 'Enable').
#    - Paste the contents of this script into the instance-user-data.
#    - When it prompts you for a key, specify the `data-refinery-deployer` key you created earlier.
#    See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-one-create-ec2-resources.html for detailed instructions.

#  - Record the IPv4 Public IP of the instance you just created.


# Finally, go into the CirlceCI web application and select the refinebio project.
# Go to the project settings and navigate to the Environment Variables tab.
# Click 'Add Variable' and set the name to DEPLOY_IP_ADDRESS and the value to the
# IP address of the EC2 instance you created.

# Now any deploys that are triggered will run on the instance you created.
