# This is a template for the instance-user-data.sh script for the nomad client.
# For more information on instance-user-data.sh scripts, see:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html

# This script will be formatted by Nomad, which will read files from
# the project into terraform variables, and then template them into
# the following Here Documents. These will then be written out to files
# so that they can be used. A more ideal solution than this would be if
# we could just give AWS a list of files to put onto the instance for us,
# but they only give us this one script to do it with. Nomad has file
# provisioners which will put files onto the instance after it starts up,
# but those run after this script runs.


# Change to home directory of the default user
cd /home/ubuntu


# Output the files we need to start up Nomad and register jobs:
# (Note that the lines starting with "$" are where
#  Terraform will template in the contents of those files.)

# Create the script to install Nomad.
