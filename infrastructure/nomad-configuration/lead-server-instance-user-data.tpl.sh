# This is a template for the instance-user-data.sh script for the Lead Nomad Server.
# For more information on instance-user-data.sh scripts, see:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html

# This script will be formatted by Nomad, which will read files from
# the project into terraform variables, and then template them into
# the following Here Documents. These will then be written out to files
# so that they can be used. A more ideal solution than this would be if
# we could just give AWS a list of files to put onto the instance for us,
# but they only give us this one script to do it with. Nomad has file
# provisioners which will put files onto the instance after it starts up,
# but those run after this script runs.

# This template varies from nomad-server-instance-user-data.tpl.sh in
# only a few ways.  Because this will be run first, it does not need
# to know the IP of any other server. Instead its IP will be used by
# the other Nomad Servers to join the Raft. Additionally since we only
# need to register the Nomad Jobs once so we do it in this script
# since it will only be run once in total (the other server startup
# script will be run twice, once by each of the other Nomad Servers).
