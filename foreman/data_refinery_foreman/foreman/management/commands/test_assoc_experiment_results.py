        The situation we're setting up is basically this:
          * tximport has been run for an experiment.
          * It made associations between the samples in
            the experiment and the ComputationalResult.
          * It didn't make associations between the
            experiment itself and the ComputationalResult.
          * There is a second experiment that hasn't had
            tximport run but shares a sample with the
            other experiment.
          * This second experiment has a sample which has
            not yet had tximport run on it.

        And what we're going to test for is:
          * An association is created between the tximport
            result and the first experiment.
          * An association is NOT created between the
            tximport result and the second experiment.
